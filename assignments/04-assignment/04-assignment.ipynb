    "4. A diet and exercise program advertises that it causes everyone who is currently starting a diet to lose at least seven pounds more than they otherwise would have during the first two weeks. Use randomisation inference to test the hypothesis that $\\\\tau_i = 7$ for all $i$. The treatment group's weight losses after two weeks are $\\\\{2, 11, 14, 0, 3\\\\}$ and the control group's weight losses are $\\\\{1, 0, 0, 4, 3\\\\}$. In order to test the hypothesis $\\\\tau_i = 7$ for all $i$ using the randomisation inference methods discussed in this chapter, subtract 7 from each outcome in the treatment group so that the exercise turns into the more familiar test of the sharp null hypothesis that $\\\\tau_i = 0$ for all $i$. When describing your results, remember to state the null hypothesis clearly, and explain why you chose to use a one-sided or two-sided test. (Adapted from Gerber and Green, 2012, p. 88)."

    "6. Sometimes, rather than calculate a budget based on sample size, we have a maximum budget and need to decide whether it is worth doing the study (that is, whether we are sufficiently powered to detect a given effect size, conditional on budgetary limitations). You find out that you only have enough funds for a sample size of 2400 in total. Using the estimate of a roughly 5% increase in test scores and a standard deviation of test scores of 16.5, what is the power of your experiment? (An approximate answer is okay; it’s hard to get exact power on the calculator this way.) The mean test score in the control group is 37. Is it worth carrying out the study on just 2400 students? How would you determine this? (Adapted from J-PAL, 2019)."

    "7. Naturally occurring experiments sometimes involve what is, in effect, block random assignment. For example, Titiunik studies the effect of lotteries that determine whether state senators in Texas and Arkansas serve two-year or four-year terms in the aftermath of decennial redistricting. These lotteries are conducted within each state, and so there are effectively two distinct experiments on the effects of term length. An interesting outcome variable is the number of bills (legislative proposals) that each senator introduces during a legislative session. The table below lists the number of bills introduced by senators in both states during 2003. For each state, estimate the effect of having a two-year term on the number of bills introduced."
