    "This assignment covers the first two classes of the course. It consists of 10 questions, each worth one point, about the fundamentals of randomised experiments and the use of theory in experimental research. You can answer the questions in any format you prefer, but I recommend using either Jupyter Notebook or PDF, as they are easier to read on Canvas. Please write at least two paragraphs for each written question.\n",
