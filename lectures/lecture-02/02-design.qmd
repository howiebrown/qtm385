### Last week

- We saw a brief history of experimental methods and their main characteristics
  - Key milestones from Petrarch (1394) to modern RCTs
- We also saw the main types of experiments
  - Lab Experiments: Conducted in controlled environments with high internal validity
  - Field Experiments: Take place in real-world settings, offering higher external validity
  - Natural Experiments: Utilise naturally occurring variations, providing less control but valuable insights
- Finally, we briefly discussed the distinction between correlation and causation
- Key tools: R/Python, GitHub, Quarto, and Jupyter Notebooks
- Assignments: Problem sets (50%), pre-analysis plan (20%), and final project (30%), with a late policy and collaboration guidelines

## The importance of a good research question

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- The answer to a good research question should produce [knowledge that people will care about]{.alert}
- Addressing the question should (help) solve a problem, make a decision, or clarify/challenge our understanding of the world
- But [an interesting question is not enough]{.alert}
- A good research design is a [practical plan for research]{.alert} that makes the best use of available resources and produces a credible answer 
- The quality of a research design can be assessed by [how well it produces results that can be used to guide policy and improve science]{.alert}: 
  - A great research design produces results that clearly point in certain directions that we care about 
  - A poor research design produces results that leave us in the dark --- results with confusing interpretation

## Causality and experiments

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}

-  As researchers, we are interested in research questions [about how the world works]{.alert}
- There are a number of different types of questions that we may want to answer. In academia, they are often divided into two broad categories:

  - [Descriptive questions]{.alert}: Descriptions of a given phenomena: e.g., “_how do teachers allocate their time during a school day?_”
  - [Causal questions]{.alert}: Questions about _how_ $X$ affects $Y$: e.g., “_Does providing vocational training to migrants improve their economic integration in the receiving country?_”

- Then we can move on to questions about why? $\rightarrow$ i.e., knowing the effect of a cause is necessary before moving on to understanding the causes of an effect.
- (Next sessions: more on about what we mean by causality and how experiments give us leverage to make causal claims.)
:::

## Theory

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- What is the phenomenon we want to explain?
  - [Our outcome]{.alert} (we are going to call it $Y$)

- Does the cause we theorise lead to observing changes in $Y$?
  - [Our treatment]{.alert} (in the context of experiments) (we are going to call it $T$)
  - We will use $X$ to refer to [background variables]{.alert} (covariates)

- What is the theory of change?
  
- We are ultimately interested in how [two theoretical concepts are related]{.alert}, measured
by [observed variables]{.alert} $T$ (our treatment) and $Y$ (our outcomes)

:::{.incremental}
- [Why is theory important, then?]{.alert}

## The importance of theory {.allowframebreaks}

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}

:::{.incremental}
- [There is no such thing as "just doing an experiment"]{.alert} 🧐
- All research design involves theory, whether [implicit or explicit]{.alert}
- Our questions are value laden: For example, social scientists studied marijuana use in the 1950s as a form of "deviance", the questions focused on "why are people making such bad decisions?" or "how can policy makers prevent marijuana use?"
   
- Why do the research? We might want to change how scientists explain the world and/or change the policy decisions in (a) one place and time and/or (b) in other places and times
  
- Research focused on learning the causal effect of $T$ on $Y$ requires a [model of the world]{.alert}: *how* might intervention $T$ might have an effect on some outcome $Y$, and *why*, and *how large* might be the effect.  It helps us think about how a different intervention or targeting different recipients might lead to different results.

- Our theories and models are important not just for generating hypotheses, but for informing [design]{.alert} and [strategies for inference]{.alert}

- Designing research will often clarify where we are less certain about our theories.  Our theories will point to problems with our design. And questions arising from the process of design may indicate a need for more work on explanation and mechanism

## Designing or selecting your treatment 

:::{style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 24px;"}

- [Operationalisation]{.alert}: The process of translating theoretical concepts into measurable variables.
  - Example: Turning the concept of "social isolation" into a measurable variable such as the frequency of social interactions
- [Key Questions]{.alert}:
  - How will we measure our outcomes?
  - What indicators will be used to represent the underlying concept?
  - How will we manipulate the cause of interest?
  - What intervention or treatment will be implemented?
- [Importance of Alignment]{.alert}: 
  - The research design must align with the theoretical framework to ensure that the study is addressing the intended questions
:::

## Let's consider the example from our experiment practicum

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- What is the outcome of interest ($Y$)?

- What is the cause of interest ($T$)?

- What can be a theory that yields to this experimental design?

- What can be the main hypothesis?

- How can we measure our outcomes?

<br>

- [What do you think?]{.alert}

## Measuring treatments

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

- [Can we directly manipulate]{.alert} $T$? (underlying treatment concept of interest)

  - Ethical, logistical and other types of considerations can limit our ability to manipulate all of the indicators of $T$
  - At best, we may be able to change [some of its indicators]{.alert}
  - We design a treatment, $T$, to do so
  
- [How does our actual treatment relate to]{.alert} $T$?

  - But our treatment can be manipulating other things (bundled treatments)

- [Did everyone receive]{.alert} $T$?

  - Measure compliance

## Measuring outcomes

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- Similarly, we often [cannot directly observe the true value of the outcome]{.alert} concept for most of the outcomes we are interested in

- Examples:

  - Correct answers to problems (indicators) for underlying mathematical aptitude (the actual phenomenon)
  - Days without food (indicators) for hunger (the actual phenomenon)
  - Reports of bribes (indicators) for corruption (the actual phenomenon)
  
- Moreover, the underlying outcome concept [may be even under debate]{.alert} (e.g., democracy)

-  If our indicators don’t measure the underlying concept that we’re interested in, then [we may not be able to learn very much, even if we have an otherwise very sound experiment]{.alert}
:::

## Thinking about the treatment from the practicum...
### How do you feel about the world?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Now think of yourselves as the researchers  

- In pairs or groups of three:

  - Generate hypothesis on potential heterogeneous effects 
  - Generate expected effect size 
  - Discuss theories behind the hypothesis and expected effect size, with emphasis on the importance of theory 
  - Other ways of measuring the outcome or mode of administering the treatment?

## Bias in published research against null results

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Anticipating or facing difficulties in getting published, manuscripts with
  null results are never submitted for review or put away in a ["file drawer"
  after several rejections]{.alert}
  
- We all face [incentives to change your specifications]{.alert}, measurements, or even
  hypotheses to get a statistically significant result ($p$-hacking) to improve
  chances of publication

- Even people not facing these incentives make many decisions when they analyse
  data: handling missing values and duplicate observations, creating scales,
  etc. And these choices can be consequential

- Overall result:  [reduced credibility for individual pieces of research]{.alert} and
  (rightly) reduced confidence in whether we actually know what we claim to
  know

## Towards review of design rather than outcomes

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- One part of solving this problem is to [focus on the design]{.alert}, rather than the
  outcomes
  
- The bias against null results can be overcome by [reviewing the design]{.alert}, prior
  to learning the results

- A good design executed well will produce credible research, which might be a
  null result. [We want credible and actionable null results]{.alert}

- Reviews of designs are also an opportunity to [improve the research before it
  is implemented]{.alert}

"...if you gave the PAP to two different programmers and asked each to prepare the data for the primary dependent/independent variable(s), they should both be able to do so without asking any questions, and they should both be able to get the same answer."

## Pre-registration of analysis plans and research designs

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}

- Pre-registration is the [filing of your research design and hypotheses with a
  publicly-accessible repository]{.alert}.  EGAP hosts one that you can use for free
  (currently on [OSF.io](https://osf.io/registries/egap/discover) using the [EGAP registration form](https://egap.github.io/learningdays-resources/Exercises/design-form.html/))

- Pre-registration [does not preclude later exploratory analyses]{.alert} that were not
  stated in advance.  You just have to clearly distinguish between the two

- Even if you will be submitting a paper with results rather than a design to
  an academic journal or you are primarily interested in a final report with findings
  for a policy audience, there are important advantages to you and to other
  researchers from pre-registering your research
  - You can learn about other research, completed and in progress; others can
     learn about yours.  We can learn about studies that produced null results
  - It forces you to state your hypotheses and plan of analysis in advance of
     seeing the results, which limits $p$-hacking
:::

## Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}

- [EGAP]{.alert} is a network of researchers and practitioners who conduct experiments to learn about effective governance and politics
- They have long been advocates of pre-registration and reproducible research, such as with their [Metaketa initiative](https://egap.org/our-work/the-metaketa-initiative/)
- [Disclosure]{.alert}: I am a member of EGAP and have been involved in several of their projects (including the courses on experimental design 😉)
- They have lots of [useful resources](https://egap.org/resources/) for researchers interested in experimental methods, some of them we will be using in this course. More in <https://egap.org/>

## The EGAP research design form

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- The [EGAP research design form](https://egap.github.io/learningdays-resources/Exercises/design-form.html) is a guide to help you think through the key components of your research design
- It shows the main parts of a pre-analysis plan, and it is a good blueprint for your own future experiments
- We will be using it in our course, and you can access it [here](https://egap.github.io/learningdays-resources/Exercises/design-form.html) or [on our website](https://danilofreire.github.io/qtm385/design-form.html)
- We will have a few sessions dedicated to discussing pre-analysis plans, but I would like to introduce you to the form today (so you can start thinking about your final project!)

## The MIDA framework

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}

- Finally, we will briefly introduce the [MIDA framework]{.alert}
- As we have seen, a good research design is a practical plan for research that makes the best use of available resources and produces a credible answer
- [But how can we assess the quality of a research design before we implement it?]{.alert}
- [Simulate it!]{.alert}
- Luckly, there is a package that does all the hard work for us: [DeclareDesign](https://declaredesign.org/)
- Helps us be concrete about the stages of research design by allowing us
  to represent them in code, which then allows us to simulate the stages of research design in order to understand the properties of the statistical estimators and tests that we use.
:::

## Introduction to DeclareDesign

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- See <https://declaredesign.org/>

- Regardless of the method, research designs have four components

- [MIDA]{.alert}:
   - [M]{.alert}: Model (of how the world works)
   - [I]{.alert}: Inquiry
   - [D]{.alert}: Data strategy
   - [A]{.alert}: Answer strategy

- Critical insight: Simulation of a research design teaches what answers a research design can find

- Working with simulated data *before data collection* helps prevent errors and oversights
:::

## Model

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- A model of how [we think the world works]{.alert}, including:
  - $T$s and $X$s (treatments or focal causal variables like policy interventions and other background variables)
  - $Y$s (dependent variables)
  - Relations between variables (potential outcomes, functional forms, auxiliary variables and contexts)
  - Probability distribution over $X$s if not also over $Y$s.

- [This is the theory!]{.alert}
  - Codified numerically
  
- [The model is wrong by definition]{.alert}. If it were correct, you wouldn't need to do the study

- But without a model, we don’t have a place to start to assess what can be learned
:::

## Inquiry

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- [An answerable question]{.alert} about the model:

- What is the effect of a treatment $T$ on an outcome $Y$ ?

- Usually a quantity of interest, some summary of the data:
  - Descriptive: What is the mean of $Y$ in treatment, formally.
  - Causal: What would be the average difference of $Y$ if we switched treatment
    to control? If we claimed that $T$ cannot cause $Y$, how much evidence do we
    have about this claim?
  - Quantity is the estimand or hypothesis
  
- Not all questions that we want to ask are answerable
  - And the range of inquiries we can ask are limited: how much can we learn
    from some summary quantity such as the average treatment effect (ATE)?
:::

## Data

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- [Realise (generate) data on the set of variables]{.alert} (all $X$s, $T$s and $Y$s)

- A function of your model

- Includes both:
  - Sampling --- how units arrive in your sample
  - Treatment assignment --- what values of endogenous variables are revealed
:::

## Answer

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Given a realization of the data, generate an answer -- an estimate of the quantity of interest (inquiry)

- This is your estimator or test:
  - Difference-in-means
  - $t$-test
  - Regression methods
  - etc.

- Answer is an estimate of the quantity of interest or $p$-value (inquiry/estimand/test)

# Let's see an example: Two-arm trial {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Two-arm trial

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- [Two-arm trial]{.alert}: A common design in which units are randomly assigned to one of two conditions (treatment and control)
- [Model]{.alert}: We have a treatment $T$ that we think might affect an outcome $Y$. We have $N$ units, which we can sample in many ways (simple random sampling, stratified sampling, etc.). We can include background variables $X$ that we think might affect $Y$, but let's keep it simple for now
- [Inquiry]{.alert}: What is the effect of $T$ on $Y$?
  - Defined by the average treatment effect (ATE): $\text{ATE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N Y_i(1) - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N Y_i(0)$
- [Data]{.alert}: We randomly assign units to treatment and control, and we measure $Y$ for each unit
- [Answer]{.alert}: We estimate the ATE using a difference-in-means test

## Two-arm trial

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
- This is a [Directed acyclic graph (DAG)]{.alert} of the model
  - [A DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) is a way to represent the model of the world, showing the relationships between variables
  - An outcome $Y$ is affected by unknown factors $U$ and a treatment $Z$ (the authors use $Z$ instead of $T$)
  - The measurement procedure $Q$ affects in the sense that it measures a latent outcome and records the measurement in a dataset
  - No arrows lead into $Z$ because it is randomly assigned

### Research design

- Good Research Questions: Produce knowledge that people care about and solve real-world problems
- Theory: Essential for generating hypotheses, informing design, and guiding inference
- Operationalisation: Translating theoretical concepts into measurable variables (e.g., social isolation → frequency of interactions)
- Pre-registration: Filing research designs and hypotheses publicly to reduce bias and improve credibility
- Reproducibility: Ensuring research can be replicated, addressing the reproducibility crisis in science.
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### Importance of theory

- No "Just Doing an Experiment": All research involves theory, whether implicit or explicit
- Model of the World: Helps predict how interventions affect outcomes and guides design
- Alignment: Research design must align with theoretical frameworks to address intended questions
- Causal Inference: Understanding the causal effect of $T$ on $Y$ requires a model of the world

## Next class

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- We will discuss [the experimental ideal]{.alert}: the gold standard for causal inference
- But we will also see what to do when we cannot run an experiment (and still use the experimental logic to infer causality)
- Natural and quasi-experiments: the next best thing to a randomised controlled trial
- I will also post the first assignment on the course website and on Canvas
- Please read [Blair et al. (2023)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/declaring-and-diagnosing-research-designs/3CB0C0BB0810AEF8FF65446B3E2E4926) if you haven't yet, as well as the required readings for next class
