# Hello, everyone! 👋 <br> How are you doing today? 😁 {background-color="#2d4563"}

# Brief recap 📚 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Last time, we saw that...

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- Selection bias arises when treatment groups differ initially
- [Balance tests]{.alert} assess pre-treatment group comparability
  - Are they useful? Sometimes. Do they solve the problem? No. 😂
- [Causal diagrams (DAGs)]{.alert} illustrate variable relationships and biases
  - Useful for identifying confounders and mediators
- [Loss to follow-up]{.alert} can introduce bias in treatment effects
- [Survivorship bias]{.alert} focuses on successful outcomes, ignoring failures
- [Post-treatment bias]{.alert} occurs when controlling for variables affected by treatment
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- [Standard deviation]{.alert} quantifies the spread of data
- [Standard error]{.alert} measures the precision of sample means (or other test statistics)
- Regression analysis are the most convenient way to estimate treatment effects
  - They can handle multiple covariates and interactions
- [DeclareDesign](https://declaredesign.org/) is a package for designing and analysing experiments
  - It helps you through the entire process! 😎

## Pre-analysis plan and final project 😊

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Now we have the final list of students enrolled in the course!  
- So we can start thinking about your project 🤓
- It will be a group project, with 3-4 students per group
- You will have to submit a pre-analysis plan, I will create a dataset for you to work on, and you will have to write a report
- [and I have a few questions for you]{.alert} (don't worry, they're easy! 😂)

## Adding covariates

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
- We can add covariates to experimental models to increase precision
- The same way we do in any regression:
  - $Y_i = \alpha + \beta \text{T}_i + \gamma \text{X}_i + \epsilon_i$
- [Freedman (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1214/07-AOAS143) demonstrated that pre-treatment covariate adjustment may bias estimates of average treatment effects, mainly in small samples
- [Lin (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1214/12-AOAS583) proposed that if covariate correlations differ between treatment and control groups, centering and interacting covariates with the treatment variable will balance the groups
- This adjusts for covariates separately in each group, which is equivalent to including treatment-by-covariate interactions
  - $Y_i = \alpha + \beta \text{T}_i + \gamma \text{W}_i + \delta \text{T}_i \times \text{W}_i + \epsilon_i$
  - Where $W_i = \text{X}_i - \bar{\text{X}}$ and $\bar{\text{X}}$ is the mean of $\text{X}_i$
  - For ease of interpretation, we can centre the covariates to have a mean of zero
- Anyway, worry not! 😅 Our friends at [DeclareDesign](https://declaredesign.org/r/estimatr/articles/getting-started.html#lm_lin) have done all the work for us and created a function called `lm_lin()` that does everything automatically!

## Estimating the second model

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=65%}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
model2 <- lm_lin(interviews ~ treat,
                covariates = ~ age + education,
                data = data2)
summary(model2)
```
:::

:::{.column width=35%}
- The `lm_lin()` function is similar to the `lm_robust()` function, but it includes the `covariates` argument
- As you can see, the results are pretty similar to the previous model
- The treatment effect is slightly higher, and the standard error is slightly smaller
- The `_c` part of the variable names indicates that the variables are centred
:::
:::
:::

## Sub-group analysis

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=35%}
- We can also estimate the treatment effect for sub-groups of the population
- This is useful when we suspect that the treatment effect may vary across known dimensions
- For instance, we can estimate the treatment effect for people with high and low levels of education
- We can do this by [including an interaction term between the treatment variable and the covariate of interest]{.alert}
- [Interpretation]{.alert}: The treatment effect for the high-education subgroup (`high_edu = 1`) is 0.097 larger than for the low-education subgroup 
- Total treatment effect for `high_edu = 1: 5.101 + 0.097 = 5.198` 
:::

:::{.column width=65%}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Create a binary subgroup (e.g., "high" vs. "low" education)
data2$high_edu <- ifelse(data2$education > median(data2$education), 1, 0)

# Fit an interaction model with covariates
model_interaction <- lm_robust(
  interviews ~ treat * high_edu + age + education,
  data = data2)

# Summarize results

# Hypothesis Testing 👩🏻‍🔬 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## What is a hypothesis test? 🤔

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- A [hypothesis test]{.alert} is an evaluation of a particular hypothesis about the population distribution
- Statistical thought experiments: 
  - Assume we know (part of) the true DGP
  - Use tools of probability to see what types of data we should see under this assumption 
  - Compare our observed data to this thought experiment.
- Statistical [proof by contradiction]{.alert}: 
  - We assume the null hypothesis is true
  - We calculate the probability of observing our data under this assumption
  - If this probability is very low, we reject the null hypothesis
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- [Null hypothesis]{.alert} ($H_0$): A proposed value for a population parameter
  - This is usually "no effect/difference/relationship"
  - We denote this as $H_0: \theta = \theta_0$
  - For instance, information about user ratings does not affect cancellation rates: $H_0: \mu_y - \mu_n = 0$
- [Alternative hypothesis]{.alert} ($H_1$): A different value for the population parameter, which we are interested in
  - This is usually "there is an effect"
  - $H_1: \theta \neq \theta_0$
  - For instance, information about user ratings does affect cancellation rates: $H_1: \mu_y - \mu_n \neq 0$
- [Always mutually exclusive]{.alert}
:::
:::
:::

## General framework for hypothesis testing

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 23px;"}
- A [hypothesis test]{.alert} chooses whether or not to reject the null hypothesis based on the data we observe.
- Rejection based on a [test statistic]{.alert}, $T_n = T(Y_1, ..., Y_n)$
    - Will help us adjudicate between the null and the alternative
    - Typically: larger values of $T_n  → null$ less plausible

- The [rejection region]{.alert}, $R$, contains the values of $T_n$ for which we reject the null.
    - These are the areas that indicate that there is evidence against the null.
- Two-sided alternative (our focus):
    - $H_0 : \mu_y - \mu_x = 0$ and $H_a : \mu_y - \mu_x \neq 0$
    - Implies that $T_n >> 0$ or $T_n << 0$ will be evidence against the null
    - Rejection regions: $|T_n| > c$ for some value $c$
- How to determine these regions?
:::

## Type I and Type II errors

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- A [Type I]{.alert} error is when we reject the null hypothesis when it is in fact true 
  - We say that information has no effect when it does
  - A false discovery (very bad, thus type I)

- A [Type II]{.alert} error is when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is false
  - We say that information has an effect when it does not
  - A missed opportunity (not as bad, thus type II)
- The probability of a Type I error is denoted by $\alpha$
- Choose a level of significance $\alpha$ 
  - Convention in social sciences is $\alpha = 0.05$, but nothing magical there
  - Particle physicists at CERN use $\alpha \approx \frac{1}{1,750,000}$
  - Lower values of $\alpha$ guard against "flukes" but increase barriers to discovery

## Hypothesis testing steps

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 26px;"}
1. Choose null and alternative hypotheses (e.g., $H_0 : \mu_y - \mu_x = 0$ vs. $H_a : \mu_y - \mu_x \neq 0$).
2. Choose a test statistic (e.g., $T_n = \frac{\hat{D}_n}{se[\hat{D}_n]}$).
3. Choose a significance level, $\alpha$ (e.g., $\alpha = 0.05$).
4. Determine the rejection region (e.g., $|T_n| > 1.96$).
5. Reject the null hypothesis if the test statistic falls within the rejection region; otherwise, fail to reject.
:::

## Rejection regions

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
- The rejection region is determined by the critical values, $c$, which are defined by the significance level, $\alpha$

## Average treatment effect (ATE) hypothesis testing

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- We have already seen one way to test hypotheses using the potential outcomes framework
  - We estimate the [average treatment effect (ATE)]{.alert} and see if the confidence interval includes zero
- This is known as the [Jerzy Neyman approach]{.alert} to hypothesis testing
- As potential outcomes are unobservable, we use the observed data to estimate the ATE after randomisation
- Neyman has had such a huge impact of experimental methods that many scholars call the potential outcomes framework [the Neyman-Rubin model]{.alert}. 
  - See [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199286546.003.0011) for more details, and [here](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-5/issue-4/On-the-Application-of-Probability-Theory-to-Agricultural-Experiments-Essay/10.1214/ss/1177012032.full) for a paper by Rubin on the importance of Neyman's work

## Sharp null hypothesis 🧐

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- But there is another interesting way to test hypotheses!
- The [sharp null hypothesis]{.alert} is a hypothesis that is true for all units in the population
  - For instance, "everyone in the population has the same potential outcome under treatment and control"
  - This is a very strong assumption, but it is useful for testing the average treatment effect
  - It is also known as the [Ronald Fisher approach]{.alert} to hypothesis testing
- It is based on $p$-values and sampling distributions
- For a comprehensive discussion of the sharp null hypothesis, see [Imbens and Rubin (2015)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/causal-inference-for-statistics-social-and-biomedical-sciences/fishers-exact-pvalues-for-completely-randomized-experiments/23AF990D2EF9C90D0A424D555FACE578)
- Let's see how it works! 😊

## Hypothesis testing with the sharp null hypothesis
### Randomisation inference

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- [Sampling variability]{.alert} is a crucial topic in experimental design and analysis
- A single experiment provides just [one of many possible datasets]{.alert}generated by random assignment
- The estimate of the average treatment effect can vary [substantially]{.alert} depending on the random assignment
- The [sampling distribution]{.alert} (or [randomisation distribution]{.alert}) refers to the collection of estimates from every possible random assignment
- This hypothesis testing approach is [broadly applicable]{.alert}, not limited by sample size or outcome distribution, and can be used with counts, durations, or ranks
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- In theory, this calculation can be done for any experiment size, but the number of possible random assignments becomes very large as $N$ increases
- For example, an experiment with $N = 50$ and half assigned to treatment has more than [126 trillion randomisations]{.alert} 😮
  - $\frac{50!}{25! \times 25!} = 126,410,606,437,752$
- But we can approximate the sampling distribution by sampling from all possible random assignments
- Calculating p-values based on an inventory of possible randomisations is called [randomisation inference]{.alert}
:::
:::
:::

## Randomisation inference in R

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 26px;"}
- [There is an R package for that!]{.alert} 😊
- The `ri2` package provides tools for randomisation inference, and it was made by the same people who created the `estimatr` package
- You can find more information about the package [here](https://alexandercoppock.com/ri2/)
- Just install it with `install.packages("ri2")` and load it with `library(ri2)`
- The package supports all the randomisation procedures that can be described by the `randomizr` package
- Let's see how it works!
- Another package that I found useful (and broadly similar to `ri2`) is the `ritest` package, available on GitHub: <https://github.com/grantmcdermott/ritest>
:::

## Example 
### Do female council heads allocate more resources to water sanitation?

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Gerber and Green (2012) describe a hypothetical experiment in which 2 of 7 villages are assigned a female council head and the outcome is the share of the local budget allocated to water sanitation
- Their table 2.2 describes one way the experiment could have come out

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
library(ri2)
library(estimatr)

# Create the data
table_2_2 <- data.frame(T = c(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1),
                        Y = c(15, 15, 20, 20, 10, 15, 30))

## Another example!
### Effect of not having a runoff in sub-Sarahan Africa

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=45%}
- The data to the right, from [Glynn and Ichino (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12154), examines the relationship between the absence of a runoff election ($A_i = 1$) and harassment of opposition parties ($Y_i$).
- Data was collected from 10 sub-Saharan African countries
- The study suggests that without runoff elections, incumbents can win with a simple plurality, reducing their need to court smaller parties
- This creates incentives to suppress turnout through intimidation
- Conversely, with a runoff ($A_i = 0$), incumbents need broader support and are more likely to engage smaller parties rather than intimidate them

  - [Alternative theories]{.alert}: Increased community engagement and public awareness, that generates other forms of engagement and pressuring. Increased media coverage of school construction could coincide with the programme

- [Hypothesis for alternative outcome]{.alert}: With an increase in media attention regarding public works, we would expect an overall improvement in public services, not a change that is specific to the treatment group.

- [Alternative explanations if results are inconsistent with hypotheses]{.alert}:
  - [Alternative theories]{.alert}: Difficulties in differentiating political corruption from budget issues; the lack of political pressure; the lack of trust in representatives
  - [Hypothesis for alternative outcome]{.alert}: Citizens may not trust their representatives and think the problems are related to austerity instead of corruption

## Section 3: Intervention

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 19px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
-   [Status Quo]{.alert}:
    -   School construction projects in Brazil often face delays.
    -   No prior system for citizens to directly report problems and pressure authorities in this way.
-   [Intervention]{.alert}:
    -   Mobile app (Tá de Pé - TDP) enabling citizens to monitor school construction sites.
    -   Features: submit photos, check status, send requests to mayor's offices.
-   [Control]{.alert}:
    -   Intervention 1: No access to TDP app in control municipalities.
    -   Intervention 2: No access to TDP app at control schools.
    -   Pure control (no intervention); controls for external factors and placebo effects associated to knowing about the existance of the app.
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
-   [Units]{.alert}:
    -   Intervention 1: Municipality level.
    -   Intervention 2: School level.
    -   Outcomes measured at the same level (municipality and school, respectively).
-   [Compliance]{.alert}:
    -   "Taking" the intervention means the municipality/school had access to the app.
    -   Compliance is whether the app was accessible, not level of engagement.
-   [Non-Compliance]{.alert}:
    -   Potential for users in control group to download the app, but data analysis accounts for this.
    -   No concern about those in treatment group not using the app as participation is voluntary.
-   [Ethics]{.alert}:
    -   Control is status quo, so no worse than current conditions.
    -   No coercion as app is voluntary.

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 19px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
-   [Primary Outcome]{.alert}: Completion status of school construction projects.
-   [Measurement]{.alert}:
    -   Percentage of project completed (continuous).
    -   Difference in completion before/after intervention (continuous).
    -   Finished construction (binary).
    -   Cancelled construction (binary).
    -   Number of updated completion dates by firms (count).
    -   Data comes from the Ministry of Education's SIMEC platform, and was accessed via their API.
-   [Priors]{.alert}: Prior studies showed variation in project completion rates, with delays common.
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
-   [Validity and measurement error]{.alert}:
    -   Data is based on official government records, reducing untruthful reporting concerns.
    -   Potential for time lags in updating information, but not a major concern for the study design.
-   [Covariates]{.alert}:
    -   Municipal population, poverty, federal transfers, primary and secondary school quality.
    -   Data is from the Brazilian Ministry of Education and the Brazilian Census.
    -   No additional outcomes or covariates collected to distinguish between explanations and alternatives; however, the randomization at the municipality/school level is designed to account for these biases.
-   [Ethics]{.alert}:
    -   Data collection from SIMEC data is minimal in burden and has clear benefits for public policy and accountability.

## Section 5: Randomisation

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 23px;"}
-   [Randomisation strategy]{.alert}:
    -   Intervention 1: Cluster randomisation at the municipal level.
    -   Intervention 2: Blocked randomisation at the school level.
-   [Blocks]{.alert}:
    -   Intervention 1: No blocks.
    -   Intervention 2: Blocks created based on the strata (Brazilian states, construction status, and municipal spending median).
-   [Clusters]{.alert}:
    -   Intervention 1: Clusters are municipalities. 344 control clusters and 2642 treatment clusters.
    -   Intervention 2: Not clustered.
    -   Randomising at the individual level was not feasible.

    -   Cluster-robust standard errors at the school level for intervention 2.
-   [Test]{.alert}:
    -   Randomisation Inference tests are employed in addition to standard t-tests for p-values
-   [Missing Data]{.alert}:
    -   Missing data is not a significant concern.
-   [Effect size]{.alert}:
    -   Expected effect size is based on prior studies and theoretical expectations.
    -   Minimum effect sizes are not determined a priori.
     - Similar studies had mixed effect sizes.
- [Power]{.alert}:
    - Sample sizes were chosen to detect effect sizes that are likely to have practical implications on policy.

## Section 7: Implementation

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 21px;"}
-   [Randomisation]{.alert}:
    -   Randomisation was conducted on a computer.
-   [Implementation]{.alert}:
    -   Transparência Brasil implemented the intervention by creating the app and by making it available in a subset of municipalities/schools.
    -   No direct dangers to the research team or enumerators, as all data was collected through APIs and public databases.
    -   Implementation was tracked via app downloads and user sessions.
-  [Compliance]{.alert}:
     - Compliance measured by analysing whether the app was available for use in a given location.
     - All compliance data came from the app store and from usage logs.
-   [Data management]{.alert}:
    -   Data was stored securely on cloud servers.
    -   Data was anonymised by using city/school identification and not user's information.
    -   Publicly available data was collected directly via APIs or downloaded directly from the ministry's site.
